# HADS_Predicting-Current-Market-Value-of-Single-Family-Housing-Units
Predicting current market value of single family housing units

All files are self-contained analysis reports that include necessary variables.

Many businesses still use Excel as a primary "database"/data storage device; to accomodate this, all files are Excel based and analysis was run using Excel.

Inferential data analysis was conducted using multivariate linear regression to predict current market value of single family housing units for 2013. 


## Processing Instructions:
Use Excel or application that can open .xlsx files to view the analysis report.
Each worksheet is labeled to include "Summary Report", "Descriptive Statistics", "Graphs/Charts", and "Statistical Test".
Data Analysis Report is in pdf.
Codebook is in pdf.


## Steps to Transformation:
### Data was tidied by:
- Dataset was downloaded from host website: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html
- Data was cleaned to include only single-family houses, flats, apartments with Fair Market Value of more than $1000.00 owned in 2013 as this was the subset that stakeholders wanted to focus on.
  - Missing values made up 4.1% of the data and were discarded per stakeholder input.
- VALUE 2013 was determined to be the outcome variable.
- AGE 2011, METRO3, REGION, LMED_2011, FMR_2011, VALUE_2013, BEDRMS 2011, BUILT_2011, VALUE_2011, ROOMS 2011, PER 2011, ZINC2_2011, ZADEQ_ADEQUACY, UTILITY_2011, OTHERCOST_2011 were determined to be the predictor variables.
- LMED_2011, OTHERCOST_2011, FRM_2011, BUILT_2011, VALUE_2013, PER_2011, ZINC2_2011, UTILITY_2011 had exponential distributions and a natural logarithmic transformation was applied for a normal distribution.
- New variables created include:
  - LN_LMED_2011
  - LN_FMR_2011
  - LN_VALUE 2013
  - LN_BUILT_2011
  - LN_VALUE_2011
  - LN_PER 2011
  - LN_ZINC2_2011
  - LN_UTILITY_2011
  - LN_OTHERCOST_2011
- 1000 observations were randomly selected as Test data; the rest of the data set was used as Training data for the predictive model.
- Worksheets were created to hold four categories for the analysis:
  - Summary Report identifies and answers the business question/what was measured
  - Descriptive Statistics identifies and calculates descriptive statistics
  - Graphs & Charts displays histograms, scatterplots, bar graphs
  - Statistical Tests holds results for statistical tests
